Building and Installing KScope
==============================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Qt4 version 4.4.0 and above
- QScintilla2 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/qscintilla/download)
- Standard build tools

Configure
---------

Edit the 'config' file as necessary.
Please make sure that all paths are set up correctly before building KScope.
Any changes to the configuration file require a fresh build (starting with 
an invocation of qmake).

Build
-----

In a shell, execute

  $ qmake
  $ make
or

  $ make debug

for a debug-enabled build.

Install
-------

Make sure you have the right permissions for copying files into the destination
directory. Then execute

  $ make install

Run
---

The executable is called 'kscopeapp' and is located under INSTALL_PATH/bin. The
shared libraries are under INSTALL_PATH/lib, so LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to include
this directory for the dynamic linker to find them.
